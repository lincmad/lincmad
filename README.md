- 👋 Hi, I’m @lincmad
- 👀 I’m interested in telephone numbering (North America and worldwide) and multi-lingual web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to combine left-to-right and right-to-left text in HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translations of place names into various languages, particularly N’Ko (ߒߞߏ) and Fulfulde (Adlam) (𞤊𞤵𞤤𞤬𞤵𞤤𞤣𞤫). I’m most interested in the names of countries and external territories, but also in the names of regions and cities, particularly in Africa.
- 📫 You can reach me at areacode άt lincmad dόt com
